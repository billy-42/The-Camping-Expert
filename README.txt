The navbar at the top links to the different pages of the website, and the dropdowns link to sections on those pages.
The navbar will stick to the top of the screen if you scroll down.
The slideshow on the homepage can be moved by clicking the arrows to the left and right or by clicking on the dots below it.
Clicking on one of the images in the slideshow links to the page and its section relevant to the image on the website.
In the supplies and campsites section, clicking on the bars below the background image at the top results in opening an accordion with different products listed in it.
The products inside the accordion can be clicked on to show more information and will automatically collapse again if another product is clicked on.
To collapse all of the products, just click on the one currently expanded.
Note: The website does use a couple styling functions not supported by internet explorer.
The website still works fine on internet explorer, but it will look better on another browser.
Note 2: The live website is located at camping.isaac.hair.name and the live README.txt is located there.
